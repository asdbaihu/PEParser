PEParser is a command utility for parsing PE files written in C.
This code is a result of homework assignments that were part of [Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/reama) course I've attended at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing hosted by ReversingLabs.
